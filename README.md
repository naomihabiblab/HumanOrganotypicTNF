# Adult human ex vivo brain slices to dissect glial biology and multicellular communication
“This repository contains analysis scripts used to process bulk RNA‑seq and snRNA‑seq data from adult human organotypic brain slice cultures, perform network and signaling analyses, and generate the figures in the manuscript.”

# Overview of analyses
The analyses in this repository cover:

* Cellular characterization of adult human organotypic slice cultures.

* WGCNA analysis of bulk RNA‑seq to define shared and stimulus‑specific gene programs and their functional annotation across treatments (TNFα, LPS, H₂O₂, BLM and control).

* Cell type–specific TNFα responses from snRNA‑seq, including DE signatures and pathway analysis.

* Validation of slice‑derived TNFα signatures in external datasets (mouse microglia, human iPSC‑derived astrocytes, COVID‑19 postmortem brains, and large AD snRNA‑seq cohorts).

* MultiNicheNet‑based cell–cell communication analysis comparing TNFα‑treated and control slices, and prioritization of ligand–receptor interactions.
